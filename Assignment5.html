        <p>I am a paragraph with a class/p>
        <p>I am a paragraph with an ID</p>
        <h2>I am an awesome h2</h2>
        <p>I often use that in situations where there are multiple floated blocks, for the last block on the right in a row. That ensures the last block doesn't have any right margin which would prevent it from butting snugly against the right edge of its parent. Each of those blocks probably has more specific CSS selectors that apply the right margin to begin with, but !important will break through that and take care of it with one simple/clean class.</p>
